# pi-supergsd

Curated, patched [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills for [Pi](https://pi.dev), plus minimal task-automation without subagents, using the Pi session tree.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-supergsd
```

If Pi is already running, restart it or run `/reload`.

## Philosophy

Pi coding agent doesn't include a built-in sub-agent tool. Its author [Mario Zechner](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/) explains why: they're "a black box within a black box" — you can't see what they do, context doesn't transfer well, and debugging is painful. Pi's session tree gives you that control instead.

This extension adds a minimal task system that keeps those principles: minimal, in your control, nothing hidden. It introduces one tool (`push-task`) and a few commands. No background processes, no parallel agents. A task runs as a branch in the session tree, so standard Pi tools work as expected. Start a fresh-context review, check the results, bring them back. Or queue tasks and run them hands-free with `/auto`, while still seeing everything that's happening and able to stop, reprompt, and continue at any point.

This extension also bundles a subset of [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills, adapted for Pi and routed through the task system rather than dispatching subagents.

## Tools and commands reference

| Command               | Action                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/start-task [model]` | Saves a checkpoint and starts the pending task in a new branch                       |
| `/task-model`         | Choose or clear the persistent default model for pushed tasks                        |
| `/finish-task`        | Returns from task branch to saved checkpoint with the assistant response as a result |
| `/abort-task`         | Returns from task branch to saved checkpoint without attaching any result            |
| `/discard-task`       | Discards a pending task without executing it                                         |
| `/auto`               | EXPERIMENTAL! Runs all pending tasks hands-free, including any queued during the run |

If `[model]` is passed to `/start-task`, it overrides the default task model and its thinking level. Task settings take effect before the task prompt is sent. On `/finish-task` or `/abort-task`, the original model and thinking level are restored.

### Default task model

Run `/task-model` in an interactive Pi session to choose from models whose providers have authentication configured. The model list scrolls with the selected item; after choosing a model, choose a supported thinking level or use Pi's normal thinking level for that model. Clearing the default keeps using the active model and thinking level. This changes only future task starts, not the current session. Alternatively, edit Pi's user-level `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (or the directory set by `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) directly:

```json
{
  "piSupergsd": {
    "defaultTaskModel": "provider/modelId",
    "defaultTaskThinkingLevel": "high"
  }
}
```

`defaultTaskThinkingLevel` is optional; omit it to use Pi's model-specific thinking level. Use the exact `provider/modelId` from `/model` to avoid ambiguous matches. An explicit `/start-task [model]` takes precedence; without a configured default, tasks keep the active model and thinking level. If the configured model or thinking level cannot be selected, the task stays pending (`/auto` stops). Pi does not expose these extension-specific keys in its `/settings` UI.

### `push-task` tool

Queues a task with `title` and `prompt`. Tasks always start from fresh context. The task sits pending — nothing runs until you start it.

## Use cases

### Review with fresh context

The LLM queues a review after implementation. You start it manually, correct review right in the branch, and then merge findings back.

```
LLM:     Implementation done. Let me queue a fresh review.

LLM:     [calls push-task({ title: "Review implementation", prompt: "Review the implementation
         against the plan. Check correctness, edge cases,
         and test coverage."})]

LLM:     Task stored. Run /start-task to review.

You:     /start-task

Pi:      [branches to fresh context, injects review prompt]

LLM:     [reviews code] Two issues: parse() swallows the original
         error, and the cache isn't invalidated on config changes.

You:     I agree with cache invalidation issue, but error handling
         in parse() was intentional. Adjust your report.

LLM:     [adjusts report]

You:     /finish-task

Pi:      [returns to main branch with report attached]

LLM:     [reads report] Good catches. Let me fix them.
```

### Batch implementation with /auto

You prepared a detailed multi-phase plan for implementing a feature, and run it hands-free.

```
LLM:     Roadmap has 3 phases. Let me queue phase 1.

LLM:     [calls push-task({ title: "Implement phase 1", prompt: "..." })]

You:     /auto

Pi:      [branches to fresh context, injects phase 1 plan]

LLM:     Scaffolds project, writes core types. Let me do clean review.

LLM:     [calls push-task({ title: "Review phase 1", prompt: "..." })]

Pi:      [branches to fresh context, injects review prompt]

LLM:     [reviews code] No issues.

Pi:      [returns to phase 1 implementation branch with report attached]

LLM:     [reads report] No issues - good. Phase 1 done, ready for phase 2.

Pi:      [returns to main branch, with report attached]

LLM:     [reads report] Great! Let me queue phase 2.

LLM:     [calls push-task({ title: "Implement phase 2", prompt: "..." })]

Pi:      [branches to fresh context, injects phase 2 plan]

LLM:     Implements CLI, adds tests. Let me queue a review.

... and so on until finished, blocked or interrupted by user.
```
